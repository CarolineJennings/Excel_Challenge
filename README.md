# Title: Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis Report
# Introduction: 
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have experienced significant growth in popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to well-known celebrities, individuals and organisations are increasingly turning to crowdfunding to launch new products and generate hype. However, not every crowdfunding project achieves success. To secure funding, a project must meet or exceed its initial goal. As a result, many organisations invest significant resources in analysing past projects to uncover strategies for success. This report analyses a dataset of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to identify trends and insights in crowdfunding campaign performance.

# Conclusions:
1.	Success Rate by Category: The analysis reveals variations in the success rates of crowdfunding campaigns across different categories. For example, technology projects tend to have higher success rates compared to theater projects.
   
2.	Average Pledge Amount: By calculating the average pledge amount per campaign, observations can be made in differences in backers' willingness to contribute financially across various project categories. This insight can inform creators about the funding expectations of backers within specific niches.
   
3.	Effectiveness of Staff Picks and Spotlights: Evaluation of the impact of features such as staff picks and spotlights on campaign success find that campaigns featured as staff picks or in the spotlight have higher success rates compared to those that are not featured.

# Limitations:
1.	Limited Variables: The dataset contains a limited number of variables, which may not capture all factors influencing crowdfunding campaign success. Factors such as marketing strategies, project updates, project complition and creator reputation are not included.
   
2.	Sample Size: The dataset comprises only 1,000 sample projects, which may not be fully representative of all crowdfunding campaigns. A larger sample size would enhance the reliability of analysis and insights. And focusing on geographical areas and ecomomies may also give more insight.
   
3.	Missing Data: There may be missing or incomplete data for certain variables in the dataset, which could impact the accuracy of the analysis. 

# Additional Tables and Graphs:
1.	Success Rate Over Time: A line graph illustrating the success rate of crowdfunding campaigns over time could reveal trends and patterns in campaign outcomes, aiding in the identification of seasonal trends or changes in backers' behavior.
   
2.	Geographic Distribution of Backers: A map displaying the geographic distribution of backers could provide insights into the global reach of crowdfunding campaigns and highlight regions with high levels of engagement, medium and low.
   
3.	Comparison of Funding Goals vs. Pledged Amounts: A scatter plot comparing the funding goals of campaigns to the actual pledged amounts could visualize the degree of success in meeting funding targets and identify outliers.

   
# Conclusion: 
In conclusion, this analysis of the sample crowdfunding dataset shows valuable insights into campaign performance across different categories, the impact of certain features on success rates, and the limitations of the dataset. Further exploration using additional tables and graphs could provide deeper insights into crowdfunding trends and inform future campaign strategies or future data analysis required.
